# notetaker
Creating a note taker app that showcases important notes users save to the app.

contributors -  Nadja Antonjak
1. I was motivated creating this note taker as its designed to keep you on track and on top of your work. keping you organised thoughout your days having everything planned out.

2. This project was built to display notes users decide to add . Being able to access the notes can help users stay on tracking with everyday life as well as school and work.
 
3. thoughout the day people always get a thought they NEED to memorise and write down, the note taker app is handy as whatever you write down can be saved untill you open the app next.

4.Throughout this assignment the biggest thing I learned was how to incorporate the skills I've learnt in class and apply it to my assignment. Implementing what we learned throughout the week in class and uploading it through heroku really put the assignment together in the end as it activates the system and updates the board of notes.
